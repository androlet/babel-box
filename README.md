# BabelBox

BabelBox purpose is to increase the vocabulary of its users.
Do remember all the translations you have ever searched for ?
Have you ever listened/read previous searched translations without remembering the definition ?

If yes, BabelBox might help you !

The BabelBox purpose is to replace your common translation software and to save translations you have searched.
This way you can learn it again during your free time, insteed of forgetting its and rediscovering its in wrong time or places ;)

## What I am supposed to do ?

First, you have to login with your given credentials.
Then, you will have access to 2 modes of the applications :

- search mode
- quizz mode

Search mode purpose is simply to search a translation for a given word (it will fetch some WordReference results).
Search mode is usefull during your english reading or listening.

In your free time, you can test yourself to see if you remember correctly your translations, if not, you now have the occasion to learn it again.
