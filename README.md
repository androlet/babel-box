# BabelBox

## Application purpose

BabelBox purpose is to increase the vocabulary of its users.
Do you remember all the translations you have ever searched for ?
Have you ever listened/read previously searched translations without remembering the definitions ?

If yes, BabelBox might help you !

BabelBox purpose is to replace your common translation software and to save each translations you will search.
This way you can stimulate your memory during your free time, insteed of forgetting and rediscovering those translations in wrong times or places ;)

## What I am supposed to do ?

First, you have to login with your given credentials.
Then, 2 access modes of the applications :

- search mode
- quizz mode

Search mode purpose is simply to search a translation for a given word (it will fetch some WordReference results).
It is usefull during your english reading or listening.

Then, in your free time, you can test yourself to see if you remember correctly your translations, if not, you now have the occasion to learn it again.
